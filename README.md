Expense Tracker App:
1. Definition
The Expense Tracker App is a simple software tool that helps users record, manage, and view their spending habits.
It allows users to add expenses, categorize them (like Food, Bills, Transport), view all expenses neatly, search by category, and see the total amount spent.

In our project, it's a Command Line Interface (CLI) app built with Python, and data is saved in a small file (expenses.json).

2. Functionality
Here’s what the app can do:

*Functionality	Description

Add Expense	User inputs a new expense by giving a title, amount, and category.
View All Expenses	Shows all expenses in a neat table with the title, amount, and category.
Search by Category	Allows filtering expenses by a specific category (e.g., show only "Food" expenses).
View Total Spending	Calculates and displays the total amount spent across all expenses.
Save Data	Expenses are saved into a JSON file so that they persist even after closing the app.
3. Features
Some notable features include:

✅ Simple and Clean Interface: Easy for anyone to use from the terminal.

✅ Persistent Storage: Your data is saved in a file (expenses.json) — it doesn’t disappear after closing.

✅ Expense Categorization: Helps you group your expenses (Food, Bills, Entertainment, etc.)

✅ Total Expense Calculation: Quickly shows how much you've spent overall.

✅ Searchable Data: Find expenses based on a specific category.

✅ Extensible: Can easily be upgraded later to add features like monthly limits, graphs, export reports, etc.

4. Uses
The app is useful for:

🏠 Personal Budgeting: Track your daily/monthly expenses and stay within budget.

🎓 Student Projects: Great beginner Python project for students learning file handling and user interaction.

💼 Small Business: Very small businesses can track minor expenses manually.

🧠 Learning Tool: Understand basic concepts like CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in programming.

📊 Financial Planning: Helps to see where your money goes and adjust spending habits accordingly.

🎯 In Simple Words:
